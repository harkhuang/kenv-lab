240150:C 27 Jul 2025 22:00:20.266 # WARNING: Changing databases number from 16 to 1 since we are in cluster mode
240150:C 27 Jul 2025 22:00:20.266 # WARNING Memory overcommit must be enabled! Without it, a background save or replication may fail under low memory condition. Being disabled, it can also cause failures without low memory condition, see https://github.com/jemalloc/jemalloc/issues/1328. To fix this issue add 'vm.overcommit_memory = 1' to /etc/sysctl.conf and then reboot or run the command 'sysctl vm.overcommit_memory=1' for this to take effect.
